# K2O - AI Assistant Platform

K2O is an intelligent assistant platform that integrates with Slack, email services, task management, and calendars to provide a comprehensive productivity solution. It leverages OpenAI's language models to understand and respond to user requests through natural language.

## Overview

K2O acts as a bridge between users and their digital tools, allowing them to manage emails, tasks, calendar events, and more through conversational interactions in Slack. The assistant can process text and image inputs, maintain context across conversations, and perform actions on behalf of users.

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture consisting of:

1. **Core Server**: A Node.js Express application that handles HTTP requests and routes them to appropriate handlers
2. **Service Layer**: A collection of services that encapsulate business logic and interact with external APIs
3. **Driver Layer**: Low-level components that directly interface with external services (Slack, Gmail, OpenAI, etc.)
4. **Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Platform resources managed through Terraform

### Infrastructure Components
- **Google Cloud Run**: Hosts the application server
  - Configured with 2 CPU and 2GB memory limits
  - Container concurrency set to 160
  - Auto-scaling configured from 0 to 1 instances
  - CPU throttling disabled for consistent performance
  - 300-second timeout for long-running operations
- **Google Cloud Firestore**: Stores conversation context, user data, and application state
  - Native mode database located in the same region as other resources
  - Used for persistent caching of emails, contacts, and tasks
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Stores uploaded images and other files
  - Dedicated bucket for input images with uniform bucket level access
- **Google Cloud Secret Manager**: Manages API keys and other sensitive information
  - Service accounts configured with least-privilege access to secrets
- **Google Cloud Scheduler**: Runs scheduled jobs
  - Configured to call the backend service every 15 minutes for cache refreshing
- **Service Accounts and IAM**:
  - Dedicated service account for the backend service
  - IAM permissions for Secret Manager access and Firestore operations
- **Enabled APIs**:
  - Secret Manager API
  - Artifact Registry API
  - Cloud Run API
  - Firestore API
  - Gmail API
  - People API
  - Calendar API
  - Cloud Scheduler API
- **Terraform Backend**:
  - State stored in Google Cloud Storage bucket for team collaboration and state locking

## Setup and Installation

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd kv2
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd logic
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `logic` directory with necessary API keys and configuration

4. **Run the application locally**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   For HTTPS development:
   ```bash
   DEPLOYMENT=local npm start
   ```

### Deployment

The project uses a deployment script (`deploy.sh`) that handles:
- Building the Docker container
- Pushing to Google Cloud Artifact Registry
- Deploying to Google Cloud Run
- Setting up necessary infrastructure via Terraform

Follow the prerequisites section before running the deployment script.

## Usage

### Slack Integration

1. **Add the K2O bot to your Slack workspace**
   - Use the `/google/auth` endpoint to authenticate with Google services
   - Use the `/slack/auth` endpoint to authenticate with Slack

2. **Interact with K2O in Slack**
   - Mention the bot in a channel: `@K2O what's in my inbox?`
   - Start a thread and the bot will maintain context
   - Upload images for analysis
   - Use reactions (üëç) to confirm actions

### API Endpoints

The application exposes several endpoints:

- **Slack Integration**: `/slack/webhook`, `/slack/auth`, `/slack/auth/callback`
- **Google Integration**: `/google/auth`, `/google/auth/callback`
- **ClickUp Integration**: `/clickup/auth/callback`
- **Image Handling**: `/image`, `/image/:key`
- **Chat**: `/chat`
- **System**: `/system/refresh`
- **Backdoor Interface**: Various `/backdoor/*` endpoints (see Backdoor Interface section)

### Backdoor Interface

The backdoor interface provides direct web-based access to system functionality and data outside of the normal Slack interface. It's primarily used for administrative purposes, debugging, and direct data manipulation.

  - `/backdoor/mail`: View all emails
  - `/backdoor/delete-email`, `/backdoor/junk-email`, `/backdoor/archive-email`: Perform actions on emails

- **Task Management**: View and create tasks
  - `/backdoor/task`: View all tasks
  - `/backdoor/new-task`: Create a new task

- **Rules Management**: Manage email rules
  - `/backdoor/rule`: View all rules
  - `/backdoor/new-rule`: Create a new rule
  - `/backdoor/delete-rule`: Delete a rule

- **Knowledge Management**: Manage user knowledge base

  - `/backdoor/create-file`, `/backdoor/delete-file`: Manage knowledge files
  - `/backdoor/new-record`, `/backdoor/delete-record`: Manage knowledge records

### Internal Solutions

K2O implements several internal solutions to optimize performance and enhance user experience:

#### Caching Mechanisms

The system uses a multi-layered caching approach:

1. **In-Memory Caching**: Uses Node-Cache for temporary storage with configurable TTL (Time To Live)
   - Language model instances are cached for 30 minutes
   - Task data is cached for 5 minutes
   - Recent event timestamps are cached for 5 minutes to prevent duplicate processing

2. **Persistent Caching**: Uses Firestore for longer-term storage
   - **Mail Cache Service**: Stores email data, headers, and content
   - **Contacts Cache Service**: Stores contact information from Google accounts
   - **Task Cache**: Stores task lists and task data

3. **Cache Coordination**: The Cache Service orchestrates refreshing of various caches
   - Can be triggered manually by users
   - Automatically refreshed on certain events
   - Accessible via `/system/refresh` endpoint

#### Code Organization

The codebase is organized into several layers that work together:

1. **Handlers**: Entry points for HTTP requests
   - **Slack Handler**: Processes Slack events and webhooks
   - **Google Handler**: Manages Google authentication and callbacks
   - **Image Handler**: Handles image uploads and retrieval
   - **Backdoor Handlers**: Provide direct access to system functionality
   - **System Handler**: Manages system-level operations like cache refreshing

2. **Services**: Business logic layer
   - **Chat Service**: Coordinates message processing and responses
   - **Language Model Service**: Interfaces with OpenAI for natural language processing
   - **Mail Service**: Manages email operations
   - **Task Service**: Manages task operations
   - **Calendar Service**: Manages calendar operations
   - **Cache Services**: Handle data caching for performance optimization
   - **User Service**: Manages user data and authentication

3. **Drivers**: Low-level interfaces to external APIs
   - **Slack Driver**: Direct interface to Slack API
   - **Gmail Driver**: Direct interface to Gmail API
   - **OpenAI Driver**: Direct interface to OpenAI API
   - **ClickUp Driver**: Direct interface to ClickUp API

#### Data Flow

1. **Request Flow**:
   - HTTP request ‚Üí Handler ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Driver ‚Üí External API
   - Example: Slack message ‚Üí Slack Handler ‚Üí Chat Service ‚Üí Language Model Service ‚Üí OpenAI Driver ‚Üí OpenAI API

2. **Response Flow**:
   - External API ‚Üí Driver ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Handler ‚Üí HTTP response
   - Example: OpenAI API ‚Üí OpenAI Driver ‚Üí Language Model Service ‚Üí Chat Service ‚Üí Slack Handler ‚Üí Slack API

3. **Caching Flow**:
   - Service requests data ‚Üí Check cache ‚Üí If missing, fetch from Driver ‚Üí Store in cache
   - Example: Mail Service needs email ‚Üí Check Mail Cache ‚Üí If missing, fetch from Gmail Driver ‚Üí Store in Mail Cache

This layered architecture promotes separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and testable. Each component has a specific responsibility and interfaces with other components through well-defined APIs.
